# Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all segments of the world's population. In addition to the health impacts related to the virus, it is apparent that much of the world has experienced traumatic stress related to human loss, unemployment, social isolation and global fear. The collateral economic and social impacts have caused devastating repurcussions on the mental health of many around the world. Moreover, the pandemic has disrupted critical mental health services and, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), demand for mental health is continually increasing {cite:p}`10.1371/journal.pone.0244809`.

Suicide accounts for approximately 800,000 deaths per year globally. 


## Paragraph on restricted services

Reddit is ranked the 9th most popular social media app in the US. The platform provides focused forums (subreddits) where users can subscribe and post anonymously. Public commentary posted to mental health support groups such as the subreddit 'r/SuicideWatch', can help to capture real-time langauge from users as they share their thoughts and experiences online.

Here we aim to find the impact of COVID-19 on mental health support groups by looking at Reddit data 'before' and 'after' the pandemic (the dataset will be further discussed in the methodology section). Specifically, we aim to focus the question:
> Has frequency of explicit description of substance abuse in mental-health-oriented subreddits changed over the pandemic.
