# Methodology

In order to investigate how substance use on Reddit has changed over the pandemic, we first introduce the dataset and then conduct an exploratory data analysis (eda) on several Reddit datasets which is described below.
## Data set

The datasets were obtained from [Reddit mental health dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3941387#.YZl5BC1h1QL), a dataset processed and organised by Low et al {cite:p}`low2020natural`. They provide us with two CSV files, for each period (pre and post pandemic), for 15 different subreddits. 

Each observation is a Reddit user's post - a message written on a specific subreddit - which has been processed to extract features that are common in natural language processing.

The feature extractions are as follows (n is the number of columns):
- LIWC (n=62);
- sentiment analysis (n=4); 
- basic word and syllable counts (n=8); 
- punctuation (n=1); 
- readability metrics (n=9); 
- term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) ngrams (256-1024) to capture words and phrases that characterize specific posts; 
- manually built lexicons about suicidality (n=1), economic stress (n=1), isolation (n=1), substance use (n=1), domestic stress (n=1), and guns (n=1). 

Alongside these features include:
- author (Reddit user name)
- date
- post
## Data cleaning

Nobby to write about data cleaning...
- what we did
- what we could have done further 
- feature engineering? create new features?

## Data analysis
To help familiarise the reader with the data, we present a more in depth analysis of the features and highlight any interesting trends. This can be found in the next section.

We perform a statistical test and report the findings in the [results](results.ipynb) section. Finally, we discuss our analysis methods and limitations in the [conclusion](conclusion.md).
