# Methodology

In order to investigate how substance use on Reddit has changed over the pandemic, we first introduce the dataset and conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on several subreddit datasets.
## Data set
The datasets, obtained from a public data resource, is called the [Reddit mental health dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3941387#.YZl5BC1h1QL), and has been previously processed and organised by Low et al {cite:p}`low2020natural`. The data includes Reddit posts from 826,961 unique users from 2018 to 2020. They provide two CSV files for each period - pre (2018-2019) and post (2019-2020) pandemic - for 15 different subreddits. 

Each observation is a Reddit user's post - a message written on a specific subreddit - which has been processed to extract features that are common in NLP. 

The feature extractions are as follows (n is the number of columns):
- Linguistic inquiry and word count (LIWC) (n=62);
- Sentiment analysis (n=4); 
- Basic word and syllable counts (n=8); 
- Punctuation (n=1); 
- Readability metrics (n=9); 
- Term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) ngrams (256-1024) to capture words and phrases that characterize specific posts; 
- Manually built lexicons about suicidality (n=1), economic stress (n=1), isolation (n=1), substance use (n=1), domestic stress (n=1), and guns (n=1). 

Alongside these features include:
- Author (Reddit user name)
- Date
- Post
## Data processing
We used the Python programming language {cite:p}`pypi` and the Pandas library {cite:p}`pandas` to perform the data reading and processing. We automated this process by writing two Python scripts - one that downloads the raw datasets and another that renames columns and reduces the data to the columns of interest. Additionally, we combined the 'pre' and 'post' pandemic data sets and introduced a new column _period_ to distinguish between the two time frames. This helped to represent the data better and allows us to easily compare the timeframes when conducting the exploratory analysis.

We selected one of the text-derived metrics available in this dataset, _substance_abuse_total_, as the focus of our study. This value is calculated as number of references to substance abuse in a Reddit user's post and is a feature that we will use to compare across the 'pre' and 'post' pandemic datasets for each subreddit.

Our final processed data sets contained the following features:

- author
- date
- subreddit
- post
- period
- substance_use_total

## Data Analysis



## Hypothesis testing using Wilcoxon rank-sum statistic

Deciding which test statistic to use when performing hypothesis tests depends on the distribution of the data and its characteristics. Given that the distribution of substance_use_total is skewed we decided to use the median as oppose to the mean for our test estimator.

Moreover, from the data analysis we saw that there was a data imbalance based on the time of data collection. The data for _pre_ pandemic posts spans 11 months whereas the data at the point of collection only makes 3 months of _post_ pandemic posts available for use. The unequal-sized data sets for each _period_ therefore allowed us to determine the Wilcoxon rank-sum statistic as a suitable test statistic.

We performed hypothesis tests with a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$, to determine which subreddits had a statistically significant difference in median number of references to substance abuse over the two time frames. The results are shown in the next section.
