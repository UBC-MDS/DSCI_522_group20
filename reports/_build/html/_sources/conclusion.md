# Conclusion

We conducted a statistical analysis on data gathered from multiple subreddits to answer an inferential question on whether the number of substance abuse references increased during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic on Reddit.

The hypothesis tests for each subreddit were presented in a [table](results.md) alongside their corresponding p-values. A p-values less than 0.05 indicated that there is statistical evidence that the median number of references to substance abuse had changed post-COVID.

We conclude that only two subreddits, _r/adhd_ and _r/lonely_ showed statistically siginificant difference. Accordingly, we reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis - i.e that in these subreddits, the median number of references to substance abuse per reddit-post _has_ changed between 'pre-COVID' and 'post-COVID'.
## Further work
Note that we did not explicitly comment on whether the median is significantly less or more than pre-COVID times. It would be interesting to compare and plot how each subreddit has changed to visually show the results.
